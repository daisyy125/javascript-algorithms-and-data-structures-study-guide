# Welcome!

Welcome to my study guide for Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass. This repository will be updated periodically as I transfer old notes/code/ideas so bear with me. That being said I hope this is of some use.

## Wait...what exactly am I looking at here?

That's a reasonable question! I started working through Colt Steele's Masterclass ---> https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/ <--- after I finished a software engineering immersive and realized there was a crucial gap missing in computer science fundamentals. As I worked through the course I realized that flooding a repl over and over with code was way less efficient than just using an editor & git to organize everything (I'm a total stickler for organization).

## Ok so what's included?

So far a review of...

1. Sorting Algorithms
2. "Advanced" Comparison Sorting Algorithms (includes Radix sort)
3. Linked Lists (singly linked & doubly linked)
4. LOTS OF PSUEDOCODE! Some is from the class, but some is my own personal psuedocode to help with the concepts at a high level.

## Running the code

I have included an index.html file for running code in the console, just remember to update the script src to the appropriate javaScript file! If you have NodeJS installed you can also run most of the code directly in your terminal.

## Updates? Suggestions?

I'm all ears! Please feel free to work off the original code and submit a pull request!

### A quick note on the code

The majority of the code here is based on the instructor's code. That being said, if I made any changes that I thought were useful it's just because I found them useful...you may not, and that's ok! A lot of the syntax in the masterclass is slightly outdated so where appropriate I have updated it to ES6.
