# Welcome! 
This is a study and answer guide for Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass. A lot of the syntax in the masterclass is slightly outdated and where appropriate I have updated it to include ES6. This repository will be updated periodically as I work through the course myself so bear with me. That being said I hope this is of some use for folks! 

## Wait...what exactly am I looking at here?
That's a reasonable question! I started working through Colt Steele's Masterclass ---> https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/ <--- after I finished a software engineering immersive and realized there was a crucial gap missing in computer science fundamentals. As I worked through the course I realized that flooding a repl over and over with code was way less efficient than just using an editor & git to organize everything (I'm a total stickler for organization).

## Ok so what's included?
So far...
1. Completed Sorting Algorithms (including bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort)
2. Completed "Advanced" Comparison Sorting Algorithms (includes Radix sort <3)
3. Completed Linked Lists (singly linked & doubly linked)
4. LOTS OF PSUEDOCODE! Most of the psuedocode is from the class, but some is my own personal psuedocode to help with the     concepts at a high level. 

## A note on running the code 
I have included an index.html file for running code in the console, just remember to update the script src to the appropriate javaScript file! If you have NodeJS installed you can also run most of the code directly in your terminal. 

## Updates? Suggestions?
I'm all ears! Please feel free to work off the original code and submit a pull request!
