# Welcome!

This is my study guide for JavaScript algorithms and data structures based on Colt steele's masterclass. This repository will be updated periodically as I transfer old notes/code/ideas so bear with me. That being said I hope this is of some use.

## Wait...what exactly am I looking at here?

I started working through Colt Steele's masterclass (link below) after I completed a software engineering immersive and realized there was a crucial gap missing in computer science fundamentals. As I worked through this course I realized that using a repl over and over with code was way less efficient than just using an editor & git to organize everything (I'm a stickler for organization).

Check out the class!

## What's included?
1. Review - Updated code-alongs from the course
2. Challenges, both solved and in progress

## Running the code

I have included an index.html file for running code in the console, just remember to update the script src to the appropriate javaScript file! If you have NodeJS installed you can also run the code directly in your terminal.


### A quick note 

A lot of the syntax in the Review code alongs is slightly outdated so where appropriate I have updated it to ES6.
